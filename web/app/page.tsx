        dl Salo is a modern classical composer - experimenting with synthesizers, noise/ambience and
        electronic music into his own classical background. His music has been featured in film and
        t.v. and widely used in performance art and dance (Saint Genet, Earth and Ceremony). He has
        performed in several music groups including Joy Wants Eternity and A Story of Rats. Saloâ€™s
        music is both haunting and hopeful, influences from minimalism and the avant garde he aims
        to create unique scores into the ether.
